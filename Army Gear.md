When you <<recruit a new army|Kingdom-Actions#RecruitArmy>>, it's <<outfitted|Kingdom-Actions#OutfitArmy>> with basic gear. The exact nature of this gear is largely cosmetic— an infantry army armed with longswords will do the same potential amount of damage as one armed with clubs or spears or scythes. You can upgrade an army's gear by taking the <<Outfit Army|Kingdom-Actions#OutfitArmy>> activity.

If you <<outfit an army|Kingdom-Actions#OutfitArmy>> with a type of gear the army is already outfitted with, the new gear replaces the old gear; if you spent RP on the old gear, you can deduct that RP cost from the cost of the new gear.

## Transferring Gear[[TransferringGear]]

You may transfer gear from one army to another, provided the army receiving the gear is high enough level to utilize the gear in question, and provided both armies are located in the same hex. This transfer does not require an activity to perform, but it must take place during Downtime.

If an army with gear is <<destroyed|Army-Conditions#Destroyed>>, all of its gear is destroyed. If an army with gear is <<disbanded|Kingdom-Actions#DisbandArmy>>, you can transfer its gear to another army as part of the <<Disband Army|Kingdom-Actions#DisbandArmy>> activity; if you don't do so, the gear is lost.

**Price** 15 RP per dose

An army equipped with healing potions (these rules are the same if you instead supply the army with alchemical healing elixirs) can use a single dose as part of any Maneuver action. When an army uses a dose of healing potions, it regains 1 HP. An army can be outfitted with up to 3 doses of healing potions at a time; unlike ranged Strike shots, healing potion doses do not automatically replenish after a <<war encounter|War-Encounters>>—new doses must be purchased.
