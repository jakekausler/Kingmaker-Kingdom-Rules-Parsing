                                You announce the promotion of a character into a leadership role, whether they’re a newly appointed leader or just shifting from one leadership role to another.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You normally perform this activity at the start of a Kingdom turn, but if unexpected events (such as the death of the character) remove a leader from a leadership role, you may immediately use the New Leadership activity to attempt to assign a new leader
                                to that role, even outside of a Kingdom turn (applying the vacancy penalty for that role as appropriate). Attempt a basic Intrigue, Politics, Statecraft, or Warfare skill check—while any of these skills can be used, each
                                skill is particularly suited to assigning two specific leadership roles.
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    Intrigue: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Emissaries and Treasurers.

                                    Politics: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Counselors and Rulers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Statecraft: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Magisters and Viceroys.

                            </ul>

                                Rulers are particularly difficult to assign; when you take this activity to assign a new Ruler, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the skill check, and unless you achieve a critical success, you gain 1 additional Unrest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether or not you are simultaneously assigning a leader, you may also use this activity to attempt to reselect the four leadership roles that you have invested. Any result other than a critical failure allows this.

                                removes this penalty, but a critical failure results in the development detailed in Critical Failure below.

                                You can use Capital Investment to repay funds from Tap Treasury (page 528). In this case, no roll is needed and you simply deduct the appropriate amount of funds from your personal wealth to pay back that which was borrowed. When you use Capital Investment
                                to generate RP, the amount of gp required to make an investment is set by your kingdom’s level. Investments below this amount cause your attempt at Capital Investment to suffer an automatic critical failure, while investments
                                above this amount are lost. The investment required is equal to the value listed on Table 10–9: Party Treasure by Level in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (page 509); use the value for your kingdom’s level under the “Currency
                                per Additional PC” as the required investment value. This is a basic check.

                                When your representatives encounter freeholders, refugees, independent groups, or other bands of individuals gathered in the wilderness who aren’t already part of a nation, you can offer them a place in your kingdom, granting them the benefits of protection,
                                security, and prosperity in exchange for their fealty. The benefits granted to your kingdom can vary wildly, but often manifest as one-time boons to your commodities or unique bonuses against certain types of events. The
                                adventure text in this campaign offers numerous examples of groups who could accept a Pledge of Fealty. You can attempt this skill check with Intrigue, Statecraft, or Warfare; however, certain groups will respond better
