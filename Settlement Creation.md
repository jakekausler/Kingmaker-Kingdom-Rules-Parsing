# Founding A Village[[FoundingAVillage]]

Your kingdom’s first <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>> is automatically founded in <<Step 8 of Kingdom Creation|Kingdom-Creation#FirstVillage>>. You can found new <<settlements|Settlement-Rules>> and expand on existing <<settlements|Settlement-Rules>> during the <<Civic Activities|Kingdom-Actions#CivicPhase>> step of the <<Activity phase|Kingdom-Turn#ActivityPhase>> of the Kingdom turn.

When you found a village, follow the four steps presented below to get started.

## Step 1: Select a Hex[[SelectAHex]]

Select a <<Claimed Hex|Kingdom-Actions#ClaimHex>> in your kingdom that doesn’t already have a <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>> as the site for your new <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>>. Work with your GM to select the specific location of your <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>> within the hex. If it contains lake, river, or swamp terrain, take into consideration the number of <<Water Borders|Settlement-Rules#WaterBorder>> you have in mind for your <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>>.

## Step 2: Establish your Village[[EstablishYourVillage]]

You must first <<Clear the Hex|Kingdom-Actions#ClearHex>> to prepare it for your village. Since <<Clear Hex|Kingdom-Actions#ClearHex>> is a <<Region activity|Kingdom-Turn#RegionActivities>> that can only happen during <<Step 2|Kingdom-Turn#RegionActivities>> the <<activity phase|Kingdom-Turn#ActivityPhase>> of a Kingdom turn, and <<Establish Settlement|Kingdom-Actions#EstablishSettlement>> is a <<Leadership activity|Kingdom-Actions#LeadershipPhase>> that can only happen during <<Step 1|Kingdom-Turn#LeadershipActivities>>, you have to wait until the Kingdom turn after you <<Clear the Hex|Kingdom-Actions#ClearHex>> to actually found the <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>>. This simulates the time that it takes to prepare, such as setting up temporary quarters or tent cities, digging sanitation trenches, gathering materials, and managing all the other small tasks to get things ready to build.

If your hex contains lake, river, or swamp terrain, you may choose which of its borders are <<Land Borders|Settlement-Rules#LandBorder>> and which are <<Water Borders|Settlement-Rules#WaterBorder>>. On the <<Urban Grid|Settlement-Rules#TheUrbanGrid>>, check the “Water” box next to as many of its borders as you like; you cannot change this decision later.

If your hex contains <<Ruins|Kingdom-Rules#Ruin>> or a <<Structure|Settlement-Structures>>, you can incorporate that building into your <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>> at a reduced cost (for <<Ruins|Kingdom-Rules#Ruin>>) or for free (for <<Structures|Settlement-Structures>>). The exact type of <<structure|Settlement-Structures>> is indicated in that hex’s encounter text in Chapter 2—the GM has full information about these <<structures|Settlement-Structures>> and <<ruins|Kingdom-Rules#Ruin>> and how they can impact <<settlements|Settlement-Rules>>.

## Step 3: Name Your Village[[NameYourVillage]]

Each <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>> needs a name. Some leaders name <<settlements|Settlement-Rules>> after themselves or their families, but the name can be anything suitable for the campaign and agreeable to the PCs.

## Step 4: Start Building![[StartBuilding!]]

Your brand new village is now ready to grow! A village must fill a single block of 4 lots before it can expand, so select one block on the <<Urban Grid|Settlement-Rules#TheUrbanGrid>> for your village’s development. Each Kingdom turn, during the <<Civic Activities|Kingdom-Actions#CivicPhase>> step of its <<Activity phase|Kingdom-Turn#ActivityPhase>>, your <<settlement|Settlement-Rules>> has one <<Civic activity|Kingdom-Actions#CivicPhase>>, which can be used to <<Build Structures|Kingdom-Actions#BuildStructure>> or other things related to improving your settlement.
